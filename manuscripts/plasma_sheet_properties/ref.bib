abstract = {The tilt of the geomagnetic dipole decreased from about 11.7 ° in 1960 to 10.5 ° in 2005, following more than a century when it remained nearly constant. The recent poleward motion of the dipole axis is primarily due to a rapid decrease in the equatorial component of the dipole moment vector. Using maps of the equatorial dipole moment density and its secular change derived from core field models, we identify regions on the core-mantle boundary where the present-day tilt decrease is concentrated. Among the possible causes of equatorial dipole moment change on the core-mantle boundary, tangential magnetic diffusion is negligible on these time scales, and although radial magnetic diffusion is potentially significant, the rapid changes in equatorial moment density indicate it is not the dominant mechanism. We show that magnetic flux transport can account for most of the observed equatorial dipole moment change. Frozen-flux core flow models derived from geomagnetic secular variation reveal a nearly balanced pattern of advective sources and sinks for the equatorial dipole moment below the core-mantle boundary. The recent tilt decrease originates from two advective sinks, one beneath Africa where positive radial magnetic field is transported westward away from the equatorial dipole axis, the other beneath North America where negative radial magnetic field is transported northward away from the equatorial dipole axis. Each of these sinks is related to a prominent gyre that has evolved significantly over the past few decades, indicating the strong variability of the large-scale circulation in the outer core on this time scale. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {THEMIS was launched on February 17, 2007 to determine the trigger and large-scale evolution of substorms. During the first seven months of the mission the five satellites coasted near their injection orbit to avoid differential precession in anticipation of orbit placement, which started in September 2007 and led to a commencement of the baseline mission in December 2007. During the coast phase the probes were put into a string-of-pearls configuration at 100 s of km to 2 RE along-track separations, which provided a unique view of the magnetosphere and enabled an unprecedented dataset in anticipation of the first tail season. In this paper we describe the first THEMIS substorm observations, captured during instrument commissioning on March 23, 2007. THEMIS measured the rapid expansion of the plasma sheet at a speed that is commensurate with the simultaneous expansion of the auroras on the ground. These are the first unequivocal observations of the rapid westward expansion process in space and on the ground. Aided by the remote sensing technique at energetic particle boundaries and combined with ancillary measurements and MHD simulations, they allow determination and mapping of space currents. These measurements show the power of the THEMIS instrumentation in the tail and the radiation belts. We also present THEMIS Flux Transfer Events (FTE) observations at the magnetopause, which demonstrate the importance of multi-point observations there and the quality of the THEMIS instrumentation in that region of space. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The spatial scale and intensity of Earth's magnetotail current sheet determine the magnetotail configuration, which is critical to one of the most energetically powerful phenomena in the Earth's magnetosphere, substorms. In the absence of statistical information about plasma currents, theories of the magnetotail current sheets were mostly based on the isotropic stress balance. Such models suggest that thin current sheets cannot be long and should have strong plasma pressure gradients along the magnetotail. Using Magnetospheric Multiscale and THEMIS observations and global simulations, we explore realistic configuration of the magnetotail current sheet. We find that the magnetotail current sheet is thinner than expected from theories that assume isotropic stress balance. Observed plasma pressure gradients in thin current sheets are insufficiently strong (i.e., current sheets are too long) to balance the magnetic field line tension force. Therefore, pressure anisotropy is essential in the configuration of thin current sheets where instability precedes substorm onset.},

abstract = {We use data from four tail seasons (2001-2004) of the Cluster spacecraft to study statistical features of energetic electrons (40-400 keV) in the magnetotail plasma sheet in combination with plasma parameters and indices of geomagnetic activity. We find that the horizontal magnetic field magnitude best orders the energetic electron observations. Using this method we observe a statistical flux gradient toward the neutral sheet. The fluxes also increase with an increase in the vertical magnetic field component (dipolarization). The intensity of supra-thermal electrons is observed to increase strongly as function of plasma temperature. Although the energetic electron fluxes also appear to increase strongly with geomagnetic activity this is found to be mainly due to the increase in plasma temperature with increasing Kp. Investigation of neutral sheet fluxes and phase space densities at fixed first adiabatic invariant ($\mu$) indicates that adiabatic heating can explain observed flux increases during field dipolarization. The spectral slope in the supra-thermal range is observed to be independent of geomagnetic activity (Kp), while there is a significant local time dependence, with harder spectra observed at dawn compared to the dusk side.

abstract = {Using four months of tail data obtained by the three-dimensional plasma instrument on board the AMPTE/IRM satellite in 1986, we have done a statistical survey on the behavior of ion and electron moments in the central plasma sheet. Almost 80,000 spin averages of plasma density, ion bulk velocity, ion and electron temperature, and plasma $\beta$ were analyzed with respect to differences between their values in the inner and outer central plasma sheet as well as their dependence on magnetic activity. The ion temperature increases with increasing magnetic activity while the ion density decreases during disturbed intervals, except in the neutral sheet neighborhood at smaller radial distances. The ion and electron temperatures in the central plasma sheet are highly correlated, with Ti /Te being constant over a wide range of temperatures and about twice as large as in the distant tail. The average ion flow speeds in the central plasma sheet are below 100 km/s and nearly identical to those found in the plasma sheet boundary layer, although the distribution functions usually are quite different. High-speed flows do occur, but in bursts of most often less than 1 min duration with intermittent intervals of nearly stagnant plasma. The distribution of flow directions strongly favors sunward flow for velocities above 300 km/s, indicating that a near-earth neutral line is rarely, if ever, located inside of XGSM = −19 RE .},

The energy coverage is from 25 keV to 650 keV for electrons and 45 keV to 650 keV for ions. Each eye has sixteen energy channels, the spacing of which can be modified by command. The fields of view and pointing of each eye are designed to provide a broad, instantaneous field of view for the twelve eyes per FEEPS. There are two FEEPS per MMS spacecraft mounted such that the pair along with the single EIS provide more than (Formula presented.) -sr instantaneous solid-angle coverage and complete coverage in the equatorial region.

The magnetotail, and in particular the hot trapped plasma sheet, is a critical region in the coupled Sun-Earth system. Changes in the solar wind have direct influence on the properties and dynamical processes occurring in this region, which in turn directly influence operational near-Earth space, the upper atmosphere, and even induce large-scale currents in the ground. As part of the European Cluster Assimilation Technology (ECLAT) project, a magnetotail plasma region dataset has been produced to facilitate magnetospheric research and further our understanding of the important processes linking the solar wind-magnetospheric-ionospheric system. The dataset consists of a comprehensive list of plasma regions encountered in the nightside magnetosphere of the Earth by each of the four Cluster spacecraft in the years 2001–2009. The regions identified are those where major energy transport/conversion processes take place and are important regions for system level science. Characteristic averaged parameters describing the behavior of each region are provided for further understanding. The dataset facilitates the use of the large repository of Cluster data by the wider scientific community.},

abstract = {Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS), a NASA four-spacecraft constellation mission launched on March 12, 2015, will investigate magnetic reconnection in the boundary regions of the Earth's magnetosphere, particularly along its dayside boundary with the solar wind and the neutral sheet in the magnetic tail. The most important goal of MMS is to conduct a definitive experiment to determine what causes magnetic field lines to reconnect in a collisionless plasma. The significance of the MMS results will extend far beyond the Earth's magnetosphere because reconnection is known to occur in interplanetary space and in the solar corona where it is responsible for solar flares and the disconnection events known as coronal mass ejections. Active research is also being conducted on reconnection in the laboratory and specifically in magnetic-confinement fusion devices in which it is a limiting factor in achieving and maintaining electron temperatures high enough to initiate fusion. Finally, reconnection is proposed as the cause of numerous phenomena throughout the universe such as comet-tail disconnection events, magnetar flares, supernova ejections, and dynamics of neutron-star accretion disks. The MMS mission design is focused on answering specific questions about reconnection at the Earth's magnetosphere. The prime focus of the mission is on determining the kinetic processes occurring in the electron diffusion region that are responsible for reconnection and that determine how it is initiated; but the mission will also place that physics into the context of the broad spectrum of physical processes associated with reconnection. Connections to other disciplines such as solar physics, astrophysics, and laboratory plasma physics are expected to be made through theory and modeling as informed by the MMS results.},

The relationship of the plasma waves to the dc field characteristics is described herein. In addition , for two subintervals which had strong ground magnetic activity, we report comparisons of plasma waves in the magnetotail to characteristics of the dc fields and fluid parameters such as the plasma flow, •5, density, temperature, and fpe/fce' Upper hybrid waves at multiples of the electron cyclotron frequency near and above the electron plasma frequency were observed for the first time in this region of the magnetosphere and occurred in regions of low •5 and temperature and high density. This contrasts with electrostatic electron cyclotron waves which occurred in high-temperature, high-density regions, as previously reported by Gurnett et al. (1976), and were suppressed when •5 •< 1. Both types of waves were associated with small dc electric fields, nontur-bulent dc electric and magnetic fields, and plasma flows of <100 km/s. Broadband electrostatic noise (BEN) and magnetic noise bursts were observed in regions where the dc electric fields and the plasma flows were large, and the dc electric and magnetic fields were turbulent. The dependence of the amplitude and frequencies of BEN on the magnitude of the magnetic field, plasma flow, density, and •5 was very complex. Enhancements at the upper hybrid frequency and the electron cyclotron frequency were common. BEN was usually suppressed near the neutral sheet but the amplitude reduction varied. The fact that the magnetic noise was most intense during tail-ward flow and often was not suppressed near the neutral sheet suggests that it may provide the dissipation necessary for reconnection to occur.},

In this study, we combined 33 years of data from the Geotail, Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms, Cluster, and magnetospheric multiscale missions to study the slow (<200 km/s) ion flows perpendicular to the magnetic field. We find that IMF By has a hemispheric dependent influence on both the tail By and tail V⊥. Particularly, the influence is more prominent in the midnight sector (compared to both the pre- and post-midnight sectors) and at distances far from the neutral sheet (compared to the distances close to the neutral sheet). However, at distances close to the neutral sheet, there is an increased dominance of duskward flows which dominates over the systematic influence of IMF By on tail V⊥. Our results indicate that IMF By has a major influence on the magnetic flux transport in the magnetotail, mainly at distances far from the neutral sheet. The influence is weaker at distances close to the neutral sheet.},

abstract = {We present remote, continuous observations from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer of the terrestrial plasma sheet location back to -16 Earth radii (RE) in the magnetospheric tail using energetic neutral atom emissions. The time period studied includes two orbits near the winter and summer solstices, thus associated with large negative and positive dipole tilt, respectively. Continuous side-view images reveal a complex shape that is dominated mainly by large-scale warping due to the diurnal motion of the dipole axis. Superposed on the global warped geometry are short-time fluctuations in plasma sheet location that appear to be consistent with plasma sheet flapping and possibly twisting due to changes in the interplanetary conditions. We conclude that the plasma sheet warping due to the diurnal motion dominates the average shape of the plasma sheet. Over short times, the position of the plasma sheet can be dominated by twisting and flapping.},

Although magnetic gradients require knowledge of spacecraft separations and the magnetic field, the structure of the electric current density (for example, its relative spatial scale), and any temporal evolution, limits measurement accuracy. Nevertheless, in many magnetospheric regions the curlometer is reliable (within certain limits), particularly under conditions of time stationarity, or with supporting information on morphology (for example, when the geometry of the large scale structure is expected). A number of large-scale regions have been covered, such as: the cross-tail current sheet, ring current, the current layer at the magnetopause and field-aligned currents. Transient and smaller scale current structures (e.g., reconnected flux tube or dipolarisation fronts) and energy transfer processes. The method is able to provide estimates of single components of the vector current density, even if there are only two or three satellites flying in formation, within the current region, as can be the case when there is a highly irregular spacecraft configuration. The computation of magnetic field gradients and topology in general includes magnetic rotation analysis and various least squares approaches, as well as the curlometer, and indeed the added inclusion of plasma measurements and the extension to larger arrays of spacecraft have recently been considered.},

Rev., 2014, this issue). Two cylindrical sensors are separated by over 30 m tip-to-tip, the longest baseline on an axial DC electric field ever attempted in space. The ADP on each of the spacecraft consists of two identical, 12.67 m graphite coilable booms with second, smaller 2.25 m booms mounted on their ends. A significant effort was carried out to assure that the potential field of the MMS spacecraft acts equally on the two sensors and that photo- and secondary electron currents do not vary over the spacecraft spin. The ADP on MMS is expected to measure DC electric field with a precision of ∼1 mV/m, a resolution of ∼25 $\mu$V/m, and a range of ∼±1 V/m in most of the plasma environments MMS will encounter. The Digital Signal Processing (DSP) units on the MMS spacecraft are designed to perform analog conditioning, analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion, and digital processing on the ADP, SDP, and search coil magnetometer (SCM) (Le Contel et al., Space Sci. Rev., 2014, this issue) signals. The DSP units include digital filters, spectral processing, a high-speed burst memory, a solitary structure detector, and data compression. The DSP uses precision analog processing with, in most cases, >100 dB in dynamic range, better that −80 dB common mode rejection in electric field (E) signal processing, and better that −80 dB cross talk between the E and SCM (B) signals. The A/D conversion is at 16 bits with ∼1/4 LSB accuracy and ∼1 LSB noise. The digital signal processing is powerful and highly flexible allowing for maximum scientific return under a limited telemetry volume. The ADP and DSP are described in this article.},

The turbulent BBF braking region is characterized by ion velocity fluctuations, magnetic field (B) variations, and intense electric fields (E). In this event, energetic (>100 keV) electron and ion fluxes are appreciably enhanced. Importantly, fluctuations in energetic electrons and ions suggest local energization. Using correlation distances and other observed characteristics of turbulent E, test-particle simulations support local energization by E that favors higher-energy electrons and leads to an enhanced energetic shoulder and tail in the electron distributions. The energetic shoulder and tail could be amplified to MeV energies by adiabatic transport into the radiation belt where |B| is higher. This analysis suggests that turbulence generated by BBFs can, in part, supply energetic particles to the outer radiation belt and that turbulence can be a significant contributor to particle acceleration.},

abstract = {Abstract. The Cluster mission, ESA's first cornerstone project, together with the SOHO mission, dating back to the first proposals in 1982, was finally launched in the summer of 2000. On 16 July and 9 August, respectively, two Russian Soyuz rockets blasted off from the Russian cosmodrome in Baikonour to deliver two Cluster spacecraft, each into their proper orbit. By the end of August 2000, the four Cluster satellites had reached their final tetrahedral constellation. The commissioning of 44 instruments, both individually and as an ensemble of complementary tools, was completed five months later to ensure the optimal use of their combined observational potential. On 1 February 2001, the mission was declared operational. The main goal of the Cluster mission is to study the small-scale plasma structures in three dimensions in key plasma regions, such as the solar wind, bow shock, magnetopause, polar cusps, magnetotail and the auroral zones. With its unique capabilities of three-dimensional spatial resolution, Cluster plays a major role in the International Solar Terrestrial Program (ISTP), where Cluster and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) are the European contributions. Cluster's payload consists of state-of-the-art plasma instrumentation to measure electric and magnetic fields from the quasi-static up to high frequencies, and electron and ion distribution functions from energies of nearly 0 eV to a few MeV. The science operations are coordinated by the Joint Science Operations Centre (JSOC), at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (UK), and implemented by the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC), in Darmstadt, Germany. A network of eight national data centres has been set up for raw data processing, for the production of physical parameters, and their distribution to end users all over the world. The latest information on the Cluster mission can be found at http://sci.esa.int/cluster/.},

abstract = {For several hours on March 24, 1995, the Geotail spacecraft remained near the duskside magnetotail boundary some 15 RE behind the Earth while the solar wind remained very quiet (V=330 km s-1, n=14-21 cm-3) with a very steady 11-nT northward magnetic field. Geotail experienced multiple crossings of a boundary between a dense (n=19 cm-3), cool (Tp=40 eV), rapidly flowing (V=310 km s-1) magnetosheath plasma and an interior region characterized by slower tailward velocities (V=100 km s-1), lower but substantial densities (n=3 cm-3) and somewhat hotter ions (220 eV). The crossings recurred with a roughly 3-min periodicity, and all quantities were highly variable in the boundary region. The magnetic field, in fact, exhibited some of the largest fluctuations seen anywhere in space, despite the fact that the exterior magnetosheath field and the interior magnetosphere field were both very northward and nearly parallel. On the basis of an MHD simulation of this event, we argue that the multiple crossings are due to a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the boundary that generates vortices which move past the spacecraft. A determination of boundary normals supports Kelvin-Helmholtz theory in that the nonlinear steepening of the waves is seen on the leading edge of the waves rather than on the trailing edge, as has sometimes been seen in the past. It is concluded that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is an important process for transferring energy, momentum and particles to the magnetotail during times of very northward interplanetary magnetic field.

abstract = {The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission and operations are designed to provide the maximum reconnection science. The mission phases are chosen to investigate reconnection at the dayside magnetopause and in the magnetotail. At the dayside, the MMS orbits are chosen to maximize encounters with the magnetopause in regions where the probability of encountering the reconnection diffusion region is high. In the magnetotail, the orbits are chosen to maximize encounters with the neutral sheet, where reconnection is known to occur episodically. Although this targeting is limited by engineering constraints such as total available fuel, high science return orbits exist for launch dates over most of the year. The tetrahedral spacecraft formation has variable spacing to determine the optimum separations for the reconnection regions at the magnetopause and in the magnetotail. In the specific science regions of interest, the spacecraft are operated in a fast survey mode with continuous acquisition of burst mode data. Later, burst mode triggers and a ground-based scientist in the loop are used to determine the highest quality data to downlink for analysis. This operations scheme maximizes the science return for the mission.},

abstract = {Flapping motion of the current sheets of planetary magnetotails is a common dynamic phenomenon. Previous studies of the Earth's magnetotail suggest that its flapping motion has two forms, that is, kink-like flapping that can propagate as waves toward both flanks and steady flapping that moves up and down but does not propagate. Although some models have been proposed to explain the kink-like flapping, its mechanism remains unclear. This paper surveys 87 flapping events statistically with respect to their flapping types, using the multipoint measurements of Cluster. The statistical results show that the up-down steady flapping events tend to occur around the midnight region, and the kink-like flapping events tend to occur near both flanks of the magnetotail. Thus, we propose that kink-like flapping motion is causally related to steady flapping motion; that is, the up and down motion of steady flapping around the midnight region induces kink-like flapping waves, which propagate toward both flanks of the magnetotail.},

abstract = {Abstract. The problem of identification of the interface region between the lobe and the Plasma Sheet (PS) – the Plasma Sheet Boundary Layer (PSBL) – using ion moments and magnetic field data often arises in works devoted to statistical studies of various PSBL phenomena. Our experience in the identification of this region based on the analysis of ion velocity distribution functions demonstrated that plasma parameters, such as the ion density and bulk velocity, the plasma beta or the dynamic pressure vary widely depending on the state of magnetotail activity. For example, while field-aligned beams of accelerated ions are often observed propagating along the lobeward edge of the PSBL there are times when no signatures of these beams could be observed. In the last case, a spacecraft moving from the lobe region to the PS registers almost isotropic PS-like ion velocity distribution. Such events may be classified as observations of the outer PS region. In this paper, we attempt to identify ion parameter ranges or their combinations that result in a clear distinction between the lobe, the PSBL and the adjacent PS or the outer PS regions. For this we used 100 crossings of the lobe-PSBL-PS regions by Cluster spacecraft (s/c) made in different periods of magnetotail activity. By eye inspection of the ion distribution functions we first identify and separate the lobe, the PSBL and the adjacent PS or outer PS regions and then perform a statistical study of plasma and magnetic field parameters in these regions. We found that the best results in the identification of the lobe-PSBL boundary are reached when one uses plasma moments, namely the ion bulk velocity and density calculated not for the entire energy range, but for the energies higher than 2 keV. In addition, we demonstrate that in many cases the plasma beta fails to correctly identify and separate the PSBL and the adjacent PS or the outer PS regions.},

abstract = {Abstract. We present a study of the spectral characteristics of protons in the Earth's plasma sheet for various geomagnetic disturbance levels. The study is based on about 5400 h of data combined from the Cluster RAPID and CIS instruments obtained during the tail season (July–October). The overall proton spectral shape is generally that of a $\kappa$ distribution, that is, resembling a Maxwellian at lower energies which smoothly merges into a power-law tail at higher energies. The actual spectral long-term slope depends on various magnetospheric driver parameters, but is on average around 3.5–4. During disturbed conditions, such as geomagnetic storm or substorm periods, a shift in the characteristic energy is observed. For two individual storms, we also found a hardening of the spectra. Unlike the electron spectra, we do not see any significant local time dependence in the spectral slope, but we find higher average ion fluxes in the dusk side. We also do not find any direct response in the energy spectra to changes in the interplanetary magnetic field or solar wind dynamic pressure. This suggests that energization of the ions are mainly due to internal processes in the plasma sheet.},

A consistent pattern is found in both the spacecraft data and the simulations: While the total temperature across the exhaust is rather constant, near the boundaries Ti,|| dominates. The plasma is well above the firehose threshold within patchy spatial regions at |BX|[0.1,0.5]B0, suggesting that the drive for the instability is strong and the instability is too weak to relax the anisotropy. At the midplane (|BX|0.1B0), Ti,>Ti,|| and ions undergo Speiser-like motion despite the large distance from the X line.},

abstract = { Electron jets, common transient phenomena for which the electron velocity is much larger than the ion velocity, play an important role in the energy dissipation and transport in the terrestrial and other planetary magnetospheres. Using the unprecedented high-resolution data provided by the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission from May to August in 2017, we perform one systematically statistical study on the electron jets in the terrestrial magnetotail for the first time. In total, 466 electron jet events are selected, which mainly concentrate in the region −25 <  X  < −17 R E , −14 <  Y  < 12 R E , and 0 <  Z  < 6 R E ( R E is the Earth's radius). The electron velocity within the electron jets is much larger than the local Alfv{\'{e}}n speed, implying that these jets belong to super-Alfv{\'{e}}nic flows. The average occurrence rate of electron jets is 0.217 events hr −1 in the X – Y plane and 0.189 events/hour in the Z – Y plane. The durations of the electron jets are mostly within 6 seconds with the average value of 2.89 seconds, which are much shorter than the duration of bursty bulk flows (BBFs) having the typical duration of several to tens of minutes. Through further analysis of the magnetic field, we find that electron jets can occur at five different structures, including 224 events detected during the crossing of current sheet, 57 events observed during the crossing of PSBL, 83 events around DFs, 79 events around magnetic holes, and 23 events around flux ropes. In addition, the relative positions of the electron jets in different structures are also identified in the present study. Our statistical results reveal the comprehensive features of electron jets in the terrestrial magnetotail, which can also be applied in the other planetary magnetosphere. },

abstract = {Kelvin–Helmholtz instability plays a particularly important role in plasma transport at magnetospheric boundaries because it can control the development of a turbulent boundary layer, which governs the transport of mass, momentum, and energy across the boundary. Waves generated at the interface can also couple into body modes in the plasma sheet and inner magnetosphere where they can play an important role in plasma sheet transport and particle energization in the inner magnetosphere. Kinetic and electron-scale effects are important for the development of K–H instability, leading to secondary instabilities and plasma mixing. The development of vortices that entwine magnetosheath field lines with magnetospheric field lines also allows reconnection and the interchange of plasma blobs from open to closed field lines. Dawn-dusk asymmetries in Kelvin–Helmholtz development at planetary boundary layers may result from several effects including plasma corotation, kinetic effects, magnetic geometry, or asymmetric distribution of plasma. Examples are provided throughout the solar system illustrating the pervasive effects of the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability on plasma transport.},

abstract = {Hourly averaged interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and plasma data from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and Wind spacecraft, generated from 1 to 4 min resolution data time-shifted to Earth have been analyzed for systematic and random differences. ACE moments-based proton densities are larger than Wind/Solar Wind Experiment (SWE) fits-based densities by up to 18\%, depending on solar wind speed. ACE temperatures are less than Wind/SWE temperatures by up to ∼25\%. ACE densities and temperatures were normalized to equivalent Wind values in National Space Science Data Center's creation of the OMNI 2 data set that contains 1963-2004 solar wind field and plasma data and other data. For times of ACE-Wind transverse separations <60 RE, random differences between Wind values and normalized ACE values are ∼0.2 nT for |B|, ∼0.45 nT for IMF Cartesian components, ∼5 km/s for flow speed, and ∼15 and ∼30\% for proton densities and temperatures. These differences grow as a function of transverse separation more rapidly for IMF parameters than for plasma parameters. Autocorrelation analyses show that spatial scales become progressively snorter for the parameter sequence: flow speed, IMF magnitude, plasma density and temperature, IMF X and Y components, and IMF Z component. IMF variations have shorter scales at solar quiet times than at solar active times, while plasma variations show no equivalent solar cycle dependence.},

abstract = {A new three‐dimensional asymmetric magnetopause model has been developed for corrected GSM coordinates and parameterized by the solar wind dynamic and magnetic pressures (Pd + Pm), the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) Bz, and the dipole tilt angle. On the basis of the magnetopause crossings from Geotail, IMP 8, Interball, TC1, Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS), Wind, Cluster, Polar, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), GOES, and Hawkeye, and the corresponding upstream solar wind parameters from ACE, Wind, or OMNI, this model is constructed by the Levenberg‐Marquardt method for nonlinear multiparameter fitting step‐by‐step over the divided regions. The asymmetries of the magnetopause and the indentations near the cusps are appropriately described in this new model. In addition, the saturation effect of IMF Bz on the subsolar distance and the extrapolation for the distant tail magnetopause are also considered. On the basis of this model, the power law index for the subsolar distance versus Pd + Pm is a bit less than −1/6, the northward IMF Bz almost does not influence the magnetopause, and the dipole tilt angle is very important to the north–south asymmetry and the location of indentations. In comparison with the previous empirical magnetopause models based on our database, the new model improves prediction capability to describe the three‐dimensional structure of the magnetopause. It is shown that this new model can be used to quantitatively study how Pd + Pm compresses the magnetopause, how the southward IMF Bz erodes the magnetopause, and how the dipole tilt angle influences the north–south asymmetry and the indentations.},

@article{Liu2014,
abstract = {Using 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of magnetotail dynamics, we investigate the onset of reconnection in two-dimensional tail configurations with finite Bz. Reconnection onset is preceded by a driven phase, during which magnetic flux is added to the tail at the high-latitude boundaries, followed by a relaxation phase, during which the configuration continues to respond to the driving. We found a clear distinction between stable and unstable cases, dependent on deformation amplitude and ion/electron mass ratio. The threshold appears consistent with electron tearing. The evolution prior to onset, as well as the evolution of stable cases, are largely independent of the mass ratio, governed by integral flux tube entropy conservation as imposed in MHD. This suggests that ballooning instability in the tail should not be expected prior to the onset of tearing and reconnection. The onset time and other onset properties depend on the mass ratio, consistent with expectations for electron tearing. At onset, we found electron anisotropies T$\tau$/T∥= 1.1-1.3, raising growth rates and wave numbers. Our simulations have provided a quantitative onset criterion that is easily evaluated in MHD simulations, provided the spatial resolution is sufficient. The evolution prior to onset and after the formation of a neutral line does not depend on the electron physics, which should permit an approximation by MHD simulations with appropriate dissipation terms. Key Points Onset conditions for magnetotail tearing are identified Entropy conservation implies stability to ballooning Electron anisotropy raises tearing growth},

abstract = {Recent observations by the Van Allen Probes spacecraft have demonstrated that a variety of electric field structures and nonlinear waves frequently occur in the inner terrestrial magnetosphere, including phase space holes, kinetic field line resonances, nonlinear whistler mode waves, and several types of double layer. However, it is unclear whether such structures and waves have a significant impact on the dynamics of the inner magnetosphere, including the radiation belts and ring current. To make progress toward quantifying their importance, this study statistically evaluates the correlation of such structures and waves with plasma boundaries. A strong correlation is found. These statistical results, combined with observations of electric field activity at propagating plasma boundaries, are consistent with the scenario that the sources of the free energy for the structures and waves of interest are localized near and comove with these boundaries. Therefore, the ability of these structures and waves to influence plasma in the inner magnetosphere is governed in part by the spatial extent and dynamics of macroscopic plasma boundaries in that region. Key Points Electric field structures and waves preferentially appear at boundaries Regions of electric field structure and wave growth comove with boundaries Data support an Alfv{\'{e}}nic wave free energy source rather than boundary gradients},

In this report we describe the EPD investigation and the details of the EIS sensor. Specifically we describe EPD-level science objectives, the science and measurement requirements, and the challenges that the EPD team had in meeting these requirements. Here we also describe the design and operation of the EIS instruments, their calibrated performances, and the EIS in-flight and ground operations. Blake et al. (The Flys Eye Energetic Particle Spectrometer (FEEPS) contribution to the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) investigation of the Magnetospheric Magnetoscale (MMS) Mission, this issue) describe the design and operation of the FEEPS instruments, their calibrated performances, and the FEEPS in-flight and ground operations. The MMS spacecraft will launch in early 2015, and over its 2-year mission will provide comprehensive measurements of magnetic reconnection at Earth's magnetopause during the 18 months that comprise orbital phase 1, and magnetic reconnection within Earth's magnetotail during the about 6 months that comprise orbital phase 2.},

These characteristics are then used as the basis of interpreting and modeling reported signatures of energetic ion/neutral gas interactions within Jupiter's inner magnetosphere, particularly energetic neutral atom emissions measured during the Cassini spacecraft flyby of Jupiter. Key findings include the following: (1) sulfur ions significantly dominate the energetic (≥50 keV) ion density and pressure at all radial distances >7 R j; (2) protons dominate integral number and energy intensity planetward of 20-25 Rj, (3) a distinct signature of local, equatorial acceleration of energetic protons is revealed between Io (5.9 Rj) and Europa (9.4 Rj); (4) significant spectral and compositional signatures of neutral gas interactions are also revealed between the orbits of Io and Europa; (5) a previously reported significant depletion of ring current ion populations between Io and Europa during the early-phase operation of Galileo (∼1995), as compared with observations obtained during the Voyager epoch (1979), has persisted and probably deepened during later Galileo phases (1999); and (6) detailed energetic neutral atom emission modeling, based on the in situ results reported here, further constrains recent estimates of the contents of the neutral gas torus of Europa.

abstract = {Three near geomagnetic tail current sheet crossings of the ISEE 1 and 2 satellites, on April 5, 1979, are examined in detail. All are assoicated with the passage of an interplanetary shock and the region of variable solar wind pressure behind it. The general geometry of field reversing current sheets is discussed, and this geometry is examined for the cases studied, by using the ISEE 1 and 2 coorbiting satellite data sets. A new technique is employed which removes the effects of a variable sheet normal velocity for the first time. This allows us to calculate firm upper bounds on the current sheet thicknesses, and by utilizing certain physically motivated assumptions, determine the most probable actual sheet thicknesses, and inclinations of the field lines within these sheets. Current density profiles derived with this technique show the main cross-tail current sheet to be a structure that is many thermal ion-gyroradii thick and which is sometimes imbedded in a region that is three or more times thicker and contains much smaller current densities. These profiles also exhibit a considerable amount of fine structure in the sheet which appears as narrow peaks in the current density distributions. Possible explanations for these structures, and for the overall sheet structure itself, are examined.},

abstract = {We report on the transient strong flow shear (large northward/southward electric field) events accompanied by energetic ion beams and localized field-aligned currents observed at the boundary of the premidnight plasma sheet by Cluster in the Northern Hemisphere and Geotail in the Southern Hemisphere. The events took place associated with plasma sheet expansion during a substorm interval, with the main positive bay onset at 1155 UT on 10 October 2001. Typical timescales of these events were 1-5 minutes. Cluster multipoint analysis showed that the field-aligned currents consist of upward and downward current layers, the latter located at the outermost edge of the plasma sheet and concentrated in a region with a thickness of 1600 km. Low-energy proton flow suggested that the electric field was southward at the outer part and northward at the inner part, with a magnitude exceeding 10 mV/m. The electric field reversal region also corresponds to the boundary between beam-like electrons and more isotropic electron distributions. Geotail observed corresponding plasma and field disturbances simultaneously inside the plasma sheet. We suggest that the strong bipolar electric fields could be related to the Hall effect of the transient reconnection process tailward of Cluster and Geotail and to the leading edge of the plasma flow jetting Earthward from the reconnection region.

@article{Owen1995,
abstract = {In this paper, we study gradients of the energetic ion intensity observed at the edge of the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL) by the energetic ion anisotropy spectrometer (EPAS) on ISEE 3. In particular, we have determined the velocity of the boundary relative to the spacecraft in the direction Perpendicular to the tail axis and the angle which the boundary normal makes to the spacecraft spin axis for 1160 PSBL encounters at X(GSM) > -240 R(E). By assuming that, on average, the edge of the PSBL is parallel to the cross-tail current sheet, we are then able to determine a number of properties of the structure, orientation and motion of the deep geomagnetic tail. We conclude the following: (1) Most crossings of the edge of the PSBL are caused by transverse motion of the entire tail induced by solar wind direction variations, although some are caused by reconfiguration of the tail due to geomagnetic activity. (2) The typical velocity of the PSBL (and hence of the tail) in a direction perpendicular to the tail axis is 50-85 km s(-1). (3) The average twist of the tail is near zero, with the edge of the PSBL (and by inference the cross-tail current sheet) lying parallel to the ecliptic plane (however, large twists are found in individual events and the distribution of twists is broad, with one standard deviation of similar to 50 degrees. (4) The width of the distribution decreases with downtail distance. (5) The variation of the distributions with cross-tail position reveals that this decrease in width is most likely due to the edge of the PSBL being concave, or significantly flared at the tail flanks, in the near-Earth region. This flaring is absent further downtail. In fact, at X(GSM) < -200 R(E), the combined thickness of the plasma sheet and PSBL may be greatest at the tail centre and reduced towards the flanks. (6) During days on which the IMF has ''away'' sector structure, the north lobe of the tail is twisted on average towards dawn by 7.0 +/- 2.4 degrees. (7) During days on which the IMF has ''toward'' sector structure, the north lobe is tilted towards dusk by 3.8 +/- 2.3 degrees. (8) A subset of events for which IMP 8 solar wind data are available show that, for southward IMF B-Z, the tail has a mean twist of -12.3 +/- 5.0 degrees for IMF B-y > 0 and 5.5 +/- 3.8 degrees for IMF B-Y < 0 (positive twist angles correspond to a tilt of the northern lobe towards dusk). (9) For northward IMF B-Z, the tail has a twist of -23.9 +/- 5.0 degrees for IMF B-y > 0 and 13.4 +/- 6.0 degrees for IMF B-y < 0. Hence the tail appears more twisted on average for the IMF B-Z northward case. (10) The distribution of tail twists is wider for lower levels of geomagnetic activity, indicating that the tail is able to twist more at lower levels of activity. (11) The data set reveals no evident effect of the Earth's dipole wobble; tail orientation appears to be controlled by the solar wind and IMF, such that the GSE coordinate system may be appropriate for the study of field and plasma structures in the distant tail region.},

abstract = {Data from the spherical double probe electric field experiment on ISEE 1 have been used to study a number of plasma sheet/lobe boundary crossings during intervals selected for the Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop 6 on March 22 and 31, 1979. These crossings took place during periods of substorm occurrence. They could be identified by keV plasma measurements and by using the electric field probes as a reference for measurements of the spacecraft potential. Typical spacecraft potentials in the plasma sheet are +10 V to +20 V. Because of decreased plasma density in the lobes the satellite potential increases here to +20 V to +30 V. Strong electric fields, with a dominant dawn-to-dusk component, are observed throughout the boundary layer outside the plasma sheet both for contracting and expanding motions of the plasma sheet and for different magnetic field directions. Characteristic amplitudes and durations are 5–10 mV m−1 and 5–15 min. The corresponding E × B vectors are always toward the plasma sheet. The spacecraft were situated both north and south of the plasma sheet edge, in such boundary layers, and in two or three cases the spacecraft were most likely on the earthward side of an X line. These latter cases coincided with the maximum of the expansion phase of substorms. Prior to these substorms, during plasma sheet thinning, onsets of sunward convection were observed by an electric field experiment on GEOS 2 in the geostationary orbit.},

Using electrostatic field-of-view deflection, the eight spectrometers for each species together provide 4pi-sr field-of-view with, at worst, 11.25-degree sample spacing. Energy/charge sampling is provided by swept electrostatic energy/charge selection over the range from 10 eV/q to 30000 eV/q.

The multipoint analysis of Cluster observations demonstrates that the higher frequency band (period is about 10 min) has faster propagation velocity (about 30 km/s), shorter wavelength (about 3 RE), and smaller amplitude (1–1.5 RE). In contrast, the lower frequency band (period is about 22 min) shows slower propagation velocity (about 21 km/s), longer wavelength (about 4.4 RE), and larger amplitude (2–3 RE). Comparison with the flapping models demonstrates that the dispersion of theoretical models does not show consistency with the results of this event, which suggests that new or more advanced kink-like flapping theories or models in the future have to consider the constraints of the dispersive properties demonstrated by this event.},

abstract = {Abstract. A sequence of magnetic field oscillations with an amplitude of up to 30 nT and a time scale of 30 min was detected by four of the five THEMIS spacecraft in the magnetotail plasma sheet. The probes P1 and P2 were at X=−15.2 and −12.7 RE and P3 and P4 were at X=−7.9 RE. All four probes were at −6.5>Y>−7.5 RE (major conjunction). Multi-point timing analysis of the magnetic field variations shows that fronts of the oscillations propagated flankward (dawnward and Earthward) nearly perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic maximum variation (B1) at velocities of 20–30 km/s. These are typical characteristics of current sheet flapping motion. The observed anti-correlation between ∂B1/∂t and the Z-component of the bulk velocity make it possible to estimate a flapping amplitude of 1 to 3 RE. The cross-tail scale wave-length was found to be about 5 RE. Thus the flapping waves are steep tail-aligned structures with a lengthwise scale of >10 RE. The intermittent plasma motion with the cross-tail velocity component changing its sign, observed during flapping, indicates that the flapping waves were propagating through the ambient plasma. Simultaneous observations of the magnetic field variations by THEMIS ground-based magnetometers show that the flapping oscillations were observed during the growth phase of a substorm.},

abstract = {Abstract. Using four-point magnetic field measurements by the Cluster spacecraft, we statistically analyze the magnetic field and electric current configurations during rapid crossings of the current sheet observed in July-October 2001 at geocentric distances of 19 RE. The database includes 78 crossings, specially selected to apply multi-point data analysis techniques to calculate vector derivatives. Observed bipolar variations of jz, often with | jz |>jy, indicate that the electric currents follow kinks of the current sheet. The current density varies between 5-25nA/m2. The half-thickness of the current sheet during flapping varies over a wide range, from 1 to 20 ion thermal gyroradii (Lcp), calculated from average temperature and lobe magnetic field for each crossing).

abstract = {The success of the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission depends on the accurate measurement of the magnetic field on all four spacecraft. To ensure this success, two independently designed and built fluxgate magnetometers were developed, avoiding single-point failures. The magnetometers were dubbed the digital fluxgate (DFG), which uses an ASIC implementation and was supplied by the Space Research Institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the analogue magnetometer (AFG) with a more traditional circuit board design supplied by the University of California, Los Angeles. A stringent magnetic cleanliness program was executed under the supervision of the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory. To achieve mission objectives, the calibration determined on the ground will be refined in space to ensure all eight magnetometers are precisely inter-calibrated. Near real-time data plays a key role in the transmission of high-resolution observations stored on board so rapid processing of the low-resolution data is required. This article describes these instruments, the magnetic cleanliness program, and the instrument pre-launch calibrations, the planned in-flight calibration program, and the information flow that provides the data on the rapid time scale needed for mission success.},

abstract = {The thinning of the near-Earth current sheet during the growth phase of the Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop (CDAW) 6 magnetospheric substorm is studied. The expansion onset of the substorm occurred at 1054 UT, March 22, 1979. During the growth phase, two spacecraft, International Sun Earth Explorer (ISEE) 1 and ISEE 2, were within the current sheet approximately 13 R(sub E) from the Earth and obtained simultaneous high-resolution magnetic data at two points in the current sheet. Plasma data were also provided by the ISEE spacecraft and solar wind data by IMP 8. To facilitate the analysis, the GSM magnetic field data are transformed to a 'neutral sheet coordinate system' in which the new x axis is parallel to the average magnetic field above and below the neutral sheet and the new y axis lies in the GSM equatorial plane. A model based on the assumption that the current sheet is a time-invariant structure fails to predict neutral sheet crossing times. Consequently, the Harris sheet model, which allows one to remove the restriction of time invariancy, is used instead. It is found that during the growth phase, a model parameter corresponding to the thickness of the current sheet decreased exponentially from about 5 R(sub E) to 1 R(sub E) with a time constant of about 14 min. In addition, the ISEE 1 and ISEE 2 neutral sheet crossings after expansion onset indicate that the neutral sheet was moving upward at 7 km/s relative to the spacecraft. Since both crossings occurred in approximately 80 s, the current sheet thickness is estimated to be about 500 km. These results demonstrate that the near-Earth current sheet undergoes dramatic thinning during the substorm growth phase and expansion onset.},

abstract = {Abstract. Quantitative relationships allowing one to compute the lobe magnetic field, flaring angle and tail radius, and to evaluate magnetic flux based on solar wind/IMF parameters and spacecraft position are obtained for the middle magnetotail, X=(–15,–35)RE, using 3.5 years of simultaneous Geotail and Wind spacecraft observations. For the first time it was done separately for different states of magnetotail including the substorm onset (SO) epoch, the steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) and quiet periods (Q). In the explored distance range the magnetotail parameters appeared to be similar (within the error bar) for Q and SMC states, whereas at SO their values are considerably larger. In particular, the tail radius is larger by 1–3 RE at substorm onset than during Q and SMC states, for which the radius value is close to previous magnetopause model values. The calculated lobe magnetic flux value at substorm onset is $\sim$1GWb, exceeding that at Q (SMC) states by $\sim$50\%. The model magnetic flux values at substorm onset and SMC show little dependence on the solar wind dynamic pressure and distance in the tail, so the magnetic flux value can serve as an important discriminator of the state of the middle magnetotail.

abstract = {Magnetic energy release during magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail leads to fast plasma flows transporting thermal energy toward the inner magnetosphere or deep tail. The interaction of such flows with the ambient plasmas is controlled by forces at the flow's leading edge, manifested as a sharp enhancement of the south-north component of magnetic field there, which has been called the dipolarization front. In this study, we examine the kinetic plasma structure of equatorial magnetic field perturbations observed behind dipolarization fronts. Using statistical observations of dipolarization fronts in the near-Earth magnetotail by Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms mission, we find sub-ion scale (scale is below ion gyroradius) magnetic field depressions (magnetic holes), mostly around the equatorial plane, drifting dawnward. They are populated by hot, transversely anisotropic electrons, likely heated around the front. Combining spacecraft observations, analytical estimates, and particle-in-cell simulations, we suggest that these holes result from the ballooning/interchange instability at the dipolarization front. They may represent the nonlinear stage of magnetic field perturbations associated with front instability, which trap hot electrons behind the front. We also discuss the possible role of these holes in scattering and heating electrons and ions in the dipolarized magnetotail.},

For many conventional 2D current sheet equilibria, this criterion is satisfied within the WKB approximation, which is commonly interpreted as stability of those equilibria with respect to tearing. However, this is not necessarily the case for equilibria with more than two characteristic spatial scales. An example for substantial tearing destabilization of an equilibrium with accumulation of the magnetic flux at the tailward end of a thin current sheet is presented. Similar equilibria are reported in Geotail and THEMIS observations prior to onsets of magnetospheric substorms and dipolarization fronts associated with bursty bulk flows.

abstract = {Modes and manifestations of the explosive activity in the Earth's magnetotail, as well as its onset mechanisms and key pre-onset conditions are reviewed. Two mechanisms for the generation of the pre-onset current sheet are discussed, namely magnetic flux addition to the tail lobes, or other high-latitude perturbations, and magnetic flux evacuation from the near-Earth tail associated with dayside reconnection. Reconnection onset may require stretching and thinning of the sheet down to electron scales. It may also start in thicker sheets in regions with a tailward gradient of the equatorial magnetic field Bz; in this case it begins as an ideal-MHD instability followed by the generation of bursty bulk flows and dipolarization fronts. Indeed, remote sensing and global MHD modeling show the formation of tail regions with increased Bz, prone to magnetic reconnection, ballooning/interchange and flapping instabilities. While interchange instability may also develop in such thicker sheets, it may grow more slowly compared to tearing and cause secondary reconnection locally in the dawn-dusk direction. Post-onset transients include bursty flows and dipolarization fronts, micro-instabilities of lower-hybrid-drift and whistler waves, as well as damped global flux tube oscillations in the near-Earth region. They convert the stretched tail magnetic field energy into bulk plasma acceleration and collisionless heating, excitation of a broad spectrum of plasma waves, and collisional dissipation in the ionosphere. Collisionless heating involves ion reflection from fronts, Fermi, betatron as well as other, non-adiabatic, mechanisms. Ionospheric manifestations of some of these magnetotail phenomena are discussed. Explosive plasma phenomena observed in the laboratory, the solar corona and solar wind are also discussed.},

abstract = {The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission is the fourth Solar Terrestrial Probe (STP) program of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The MMS mission was launched on March 12, 2015. The mission consists of four identically instrumented spin-stabilized spacecraft flying in a tetrahedral formation to study the magnetosphere of the Earth. As the MMS formation moves in orbit during the different science observation phases, the apparent Sun position shifts such that MMS experiences variable eclipse durations. By the end of the primary science observation phase, September 2017, MMS completed 792 orbits and had experienced 683 eclipse events. Seventy-four percent of the eclipse events lasted for less than 1 hour long while fourteen percent lasted between 1 hour and 2 hours long, and the remaining twelve percent lasted between 2 hours and 3.5 hours long. MMS eclipse configuration rules, inherited from pre-launch test results and analyses, implement spacecraft suite and instrument suite power configurations as well as heater and temperature setting management for eclipse durations up to 4 hours long. In August 2019, as the mission progresses into extended science observation phases, MMS is predicted to experience eclipse durations of 3.7 hours, 5.2 hours, 4.4 hours, and 2.8 hours long on four consecutive orbits. The 4.4 hour and 5.2 hour long eclipse events are longer than any tested during pre-launch energy balance simulation and analyses. This paper discusses the energy balance analyses and results obtained for the four long August 2019 MMS eclipse orbits amending existing MMS eclipse configuration rule sets.},

The simultaneous multispacecraft probing allows analyzing the 3-D configuration of the electron holes. We estimate the electric field gradients and charge densities associated with the electrons holes. The electric fields are fit to simple 3-D electron hole models to estimate their perpendicular scales and demonstrate that the electron holes were generally not axially symmetric with respect to the local magnetic field.

abstract = {The FIELDS instrumentation suite on the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission provides comprehensive measurements of the full vector magnetic and electric fields in the reconnection regions investigated by MMS, including the dayside magnetopause and the night-side magnetotail acceleration regions out to 25 Re. Six sensors on each of the four MMS spacecraft provide overlapping measurements of these fields with sensitive cross-calibrations both before and after launch. The FIELDS magnetic sensors consist of redundant flux-gate magnetometers (AFG and DFG) over the frequency range from DC to 64 Hz, a search coil magnetometer (SCM) providing AC measurements over the full whistler mode spectrum expected to be seen on MMS, and an Electron Drift Instrument (EDI) that calibrates offsets for the magnetometers. The FIELDS three-axis electric field measurements are provided by two sets of biased double-probe sensors (SDP and ADP) operating in a highly symmetric spacecraft environment to reduce significantly electrostatic errors. These sensors are complemented with the EDI electric measurements that are free from all local spacecraft perturbations. Cross-calibrated vector electric field measurements are thus produced from DC to 100 kHz, well beyond the upper hybrid resonance whose frequency provides an accurate determination of the local electron density. Due to its very large geometric factor, EDI also provides very high time resolution (∼1 ms) ambient electron flux measurements at a few selected energies near 1 keV. This paper provides an overview of the FIELDS suite, its science objectives and measurement requirements, and its performance as verified in calibration and cross-calibration procedures that result in anticipated errors less than 0.1 nT in B and 0.5 mV/m in E. Summaries of data products that result from FIELDS are also described, as well as algorithms for cross-calibration. Details of the design and performance characteristics of AFG/DFG, SCM, ADP, SDP, and EDI are provided in five companion papers.},

abstract = {An analytical approximation is developed for the shape of the nightside tail current sheet, representing it as a function of the Earth's dipole tilt angle, solar wind ram pressure, and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The model is based on 5-min average magnetometer data of the Geotail and Polar spacecraft, spanning the periods 1994-2002, and 1999-2001, respectively. All the magnetospheric data were tagged by concurrent values of the solar wind dynamic pressure and IMF By and Bz components, averaged over 30-min intervals immediately preceding the magnetospheric observations. Warping and twisting parameters were calculated by minimizing the number of mismatches between the observed and predicted orientation of the magnetic field on both sides of the model current sheet. The model is valid within the nightside magnetosphere in the range of tailward distances -50 RE ≤ X GSM ≤ 0. Variations of the solar wind pressure P change the shape of the deformed current sheet in such a way that an increase of P results in a decrease of the magnetotail "hinging distance" RH, but increases the magnitude of its transverse warping. The IMF Bz component affects the magnitude of the seasonal/diurnal motion of the current sheet in the north-south direction, and it also controls the degree of the IMF By-related twisting, which becomes much larger during the periods with northward IMF Bz.},

abstract = {During geomagnetic storms plasma pressure in the inner magnetosphere is controlled by energetic ions of tens to hundreds of keV. Plasma pressure is the source of global storm time currents, which control the distribution of magnetic field and couple the inner magnetosphere and the ionosphere. Recent analysis showed that the buildup of hot ion population in the inner magnetosphere largely occurs in the form of localized discrete injections associated with sharp dipolarizations of magnetic field, similar to dipolarization fronts in the magnetotail. Because of significant differences between the ambient magnetic field and the dipolarization front properties in the magnetotail and the inner magnetosphere, the physical mechanisms of ion acceleration at dipolarization fronts in these two regions may also be different. In this paper we discuss a new acceleration mechanism enabled by stable trapping of ions at the azimuthally localized dipolarization fronts. It is shown that trapping can provide a robust mechanism of ion energization in the inner magnetosphere even in the absence of large electric fields.},

@article{Wang2019,
abstract = {We report on a flapping motion event near the substorm onset on 17 June 2017 using Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission data. A strong current density with a maximum value of $\sim$190 nA/m 2 is observed during the flapping. The north-to-south (south-to-north) crossing of the neutral sheet corresponds to an increase (a decrease) of the Z GSM component of the solar wind V Z, SW . The periods ($\sim$8 min) of the flapping and variations of V Z, SW are almost equal. In addition, dV Z, SW /dt and dB X /dt observed by MMS exhibit a strong negative correlation. These observations suggest that the flapping motions are triggered by the solar wind directional change via creating a motion of the current sheet in the north-south direction. The pressure difference between the northern and southern lobes caused by the solar wind is expected to be a possible contribution to the formation of the flapping.},

abstract = {Abstract. We study the average shape and position of the magnetotail neutral sheet based on magnetic field data obtained by Cluster, Geotail, TC-1, and THEMIS from the years 1995 to 2013. All data in the aberrated GSM (geocentric solar magnetospheric) coordinate system are normalized to the same solar wind pressure 2 nPa and downtail distance X ∼ −20RE. Our results show characteristics of the neutral sheet, as follows. (1) The neutral sheet assumes a greater degree of curve in the YZ cross section when the dipole tilt increases, the Earth dipole tilt angle affects the neutral sheet configuration not only in the YZ cross section but also in the XY cross section, and the neutral sheet assumes a more significant degree of tilt in the XY cross section when the dipole tilt increases. (2) Counterclockwise twisting of the neutral sheet with 3.10° is observed, looking along the downtail direction, for the positive interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) BY with a value of 3 to 8 nT, and clockwise twisting of the neutral sheet with 3.37° for the negative IMF BY with a value of −8 to −3 nT, and a northward IMF can result in a greater twisting of the near-tail neutral sheet than southward. The above results can be a reference to the neutral sheet model. Our large database also shows that the displaced ellipse model is effective to study the average shape of the neutral sheet with proper parameters when the dipole tilt angle is larger (less) than 10° (−10° ).},

@article{Yang2022,
abstract = {The dissipative mechanism in weakly collisional plasma is a topic that pervades decades of studies without a consensus solution. We compare several energy dissipation estimates based on energy transfer processes in plasma turbulence and provide justification for the pressure–strain interaction as a direct estimate of the energy dissipation rate. The global and scale-by-scale energy balances are examined in 2.5D and 3D kinetic simulations. We show that the global internal energy increase and the temperature enhancement of each species are directly tracked by the pressure–strain interaction. The incompressive part of the pressure–strain interaction dominates over its compressive part in all simulations considered. The scale-by-scale energy balance is quantified by scale filtered Vlasov–Maxwell equations, a kinetic plasma approach, and the lag dependent von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n–Howarth equation, an approach based on fluid models. We find that the energy balance is exactly satisfied across all scales, but the lack of a well-defined inertial range influences the distribution of the energy budget among different terms in the inertial range. Therefore, the widespread use of the Yaglom relation in estimating the dissipation rate is questionable in some cases, especially when the scale separation in the system is not clearly defined. In contrast, the pressure–strain interaction balances exactly the dissipation rate at kinetic scales regardless of the scale separation.},

Previous Cluster observations have shown that the flapping motions of the Earth's magnetotail are of internal origin and that kink-like waves are emitted from the central part of the tail and propagate toward the tail flanks.

Using conjunctions with Cluster we will have simultaneous observations at 10-13 and 16-19 Re of these flapping motions.

abstract = {On April 22, 1979, from 0840 to 1018 UT, ISEE 1 and ISEE 2 stayed in the tail current sheet at 17 RE, crossing the current sheet center several times while the initially northward interplanetary magnetic field Bz turned southward under conditions of constant solar wind velocity and dynamic pressure. An overview of the period from 0840 to 1050 UT, discussing the solar wind conditions, the tail magnetic field response at ISEE 1, ISEE 2 and IMP 8, and the ground electrojet activities has been presented in an accompanying paper. Herein under the assumption that the magnetic field is antisymmetric about the current sheet center, the hyperbolic tangent current sheet model of Harris has been used to calculate the current sheet thickness from these two close spacecraft measurements of the tail magnetic field. The thickness varied from 2.5 to 0.5 RE during this period. The current sheet thinned just prior to a rapid poleward expansion of the auroral electrojet and just after the arrival of a southward turning of the IMF Bz and apparent tail field reconnection at ISEE 1 and 2. The plasma density and temperature distribution in the vertical direction appears to be close to adiabatic at this time and the total pressure is roughly constant through the lobe. In this case study, the polytropic index of the tail plasma is found to be 5/3 on the average. This implies that the plasma convection at 17 RE in tail was steadily adiabatic over the period of about 100 min. Copyright 1997 by the American Geophysical Union.},

@article{Zimbardo2010,
abstract = {Magnetic turbulence is found in most space plasmas, including the Earth's magnetosphere, and the interaction region between the magnetosphere and the solar wind. Recent spacecraft observations of magnetic turbulence in the ion foreshock, in the magnetosheath, in the polar cusp regions, in the magnetotail, and in the high latitude ionosphere are reviewed. It is found that: 1. A large share of magnetic turbulence in the geospace environment is generated locally, as due for instance to the reflected ion beams in the ion foreshock, to temperature anisotropy in the magnetosheath and the polar cusp regions, to velocity shear in the magnetosheath and magnetotail, and to magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause and in the magnetotail. 2. Spectral indices close to the Kolmogorov value can be recovered for low frequency turbulence when long enough intervals at relatively constant flow speed are analyzed in the magnetotail, or when fluctuations in the magnetosheath are considered far downstream from the bow shock. 3. For high frequency turbulence, a spectral index $\alpha$ ≃ 2.3 or larger is observed in most geospace regions, in agreement with what is observed in the solar wind. 4. More studies are needed to gain an understanding of turbulence dissipation in the geospace environment, also keeping in mind that the strong temperature anisotropies which are observed show that wave particle interactions can be a source of wave emission rather than of turbulence dissipation. 5. Several spacecraft observations show the existence of vortices in the magnetosheath, on the magnetopause, in the magnetotail, and in the ionosphere, so that they may have a primary role in the turbulent injection and evolution. The influence of such a turbulence on the plasma transport, dynamics, and energization will be described, also using the results of numerical simulations. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},
